# Fibonacci Number Calculator using Recursion

This Java program calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

## Instructions

1. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the `Problem5FibonacciRecursive.java` file using a Java compiler.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the compiled program.
   - Enter the index of the Fibonacci number when prompted.

3. **Output:**
   - The program will output the nth Fibonacci number.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `fibonacci` method is O(2^n), where n is the index of the Fibonacci number being calculated. This is because each recursive call branches into two additional calls until reaching the base case, resulting in exponential growth.
